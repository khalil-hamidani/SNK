The main character, Eren, discovers he has the power to transform into a Titan, and the scouts capitalize on the advantage to secure and explore territory. After being targeted by the military regime, the scouts lead a coup d’état and install one of their own on the throne.
Eventually, the scouts discover the truth: They live on an island, and there is a vast world beyond. The people within the Walls are members of a persecuted race called Eldians. The Eldian diaspora on the mainland remains scattered across internment zones and refugee camps. Other people use historical grievances against the Eldian Empire, which controlled large chunks of the world during its reign, as a pretext for prejudice against them.
The Titans are former Eldians, forcibly transformed into unthinking beasts by a nation called Marley. When Marley declares war on the people of the Walls, Eren harnesses the ability to control countless Titans, seizing sole jurisdiction over power akin to a nuclear arsenal. At the time of writing, he leads a rebel faction aiming to destroy all life outside of the island. Most of the other protagonists are attempting to halt his genocidal plan.
The Nine Titans, also known as Titan Shifters (Attack, Colossal, Armored, Female, Beast, Jaw, Cart, War Hammer, and Founding), are the strongest Titans; each is able to shift back and forth between human and Titan form to access their Titan's abilities
